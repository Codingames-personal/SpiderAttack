# SpiderAttack

The idea of this repository is to propose a ai model based solution of [Spider Attack](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2022), a battle of bot proposed by CodinGame.


## Statement

*Spider Attack is the official name of the game used in the Spring Challenge 2022*

Protect your base from monster attacks and outlive your opponent.

Two players controls a team of **heroes** . The teams start out at opposite corners of the map, near their **base** . Throughout the game **monsters** will appear regularly on the edges of the map. If a **monster** reaches your base, it will deal **damage** . If your base takes too much damage, you lose.


## The idea

I want to by have a better understanding of the AI model in general and precisely a theorical understanding. That why I will not use any library such as Gym or Tensor Flow. I will do it all by "hand". 

In a first time I will try to implement a training algorithm and then play with it.
